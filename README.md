# README

The files of the initial commit have been created by decompiling the original
module because its source code was lost. The original author, Geertjan Wielenga,
agreed on publishing it under any license. However, some issues are still open,
so **don't use it**, yet!

The editor package and its sub-packages contain experimental code, needing
modifications for NetBeans and the local Maven repository. The packages are
(only) needed for HTML support, as namespaces are not supported.

If You want to test this plugin, please remove those packages before compiling,
as well as the dependencies from the POM (see comments in the file).
