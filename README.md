# README

The files of the initial commit have been created by decompiling the original
module because its source code was lost. The original author, Geertjan Wielenga,
agreed on publishing it under any license. However, some issues are still open,
so **don't use it**, yet!

After fixing the POM to depend on implementation versions of html.editor and
html.editor.lib this project should be possible to compile now. If not, please
create an issue.
